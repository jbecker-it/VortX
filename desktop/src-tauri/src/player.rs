//! Embedded mpv (libmpv) player for the desktop app.
//!
//! WHY mpv on desktop. The frontend's first player was a webview `<video>` (see the old
//! `openPlayer` in src/main.ts): the OS WebView2/WebKitGTK pipeline plays plain H.264/AAC fine but
//! is unreliable for HEVC and Dolby Vision (no DV layer handling, spotty HEVC on Windows without the
//! paid HEVC extension). mpv is the same player the Apple apps use (libmpv / MPVKit there), so this
//! gives desktop the same broad-codec, DV-aware playback. We spawn the standalone `mpv` BINARY as a
//! child process (the Tauri/Rust twin of the macOS app's child-process model) and drive it over
//! mpv's JSON IPC, rather than linking libmpv directly. It keeps the bundle a plain executable drop
//! (mirroring how server.cjs + the node-* runtime are staged) and avoids a C-ABI/render-context
//! integration on three windowing systems.
//!
//! HONEST DV NOTE. mpv on desktop does DV-AWARE TONEMAPPING, NOT true Dolby Vision passthrough.
//! With `vo=gpu-next` + libplacebo, mpv reads the DV RPU and tonemaps the HDR image for the display;
//! it does not emit a DV bitstream to a DV-capable TV/monitor the way an AVPlayer/hardware DV path
//! would. So a DV title plays and looks right (HDR tonemapped), but this is not certified DV
//! passthrough. Document this expectation rather than implying parity with hardware DV.
//!
//! TORRENT GATE. This module is only ever handed a URL that is ALREADY playable: the frontend's
//! detail.ts runs the unchanged prepareTorrent -> resolveUrl pipeline (server.ts), which returns a
//! loopback `http://127.0.0.1:11470/<hash>/<idx>` URL ONLY after `isListening()` is true, and null
//! otherwise. `mpv_play` additionally refuses any loopback URL when the embedded server is not
//! listening, as a defensive backstop so a future caller can't bypass the gate.
//!
//! How it's wired: the frontend calls the `mpv_play` / `mpv_command` / `mpv_stop` Tauri commands
//! (see lib.rs). `mpv_play` spawns mpv bound to a borderless child window (`--wid=<handle>` when a
//! parent is available, else its own window) with an IPC server, waits for the socket, then sends
//! `loadfile`. Subsequent transport (pause/seek/quit) goes through `mpv_command`. The child is
//! force-killed on stop and on app exit so we never orphan an mpv process.

/// User-configurable streaming/seek cache for the libmpv player.
///
/// libmpv keeps a forward read-ahead buffer (`demuxer-max-bytes`) so the play head can run ahead of
/// the network. By default that buffer lives in RAM, which on the in-process, jetsam-bound iOS/tvOS
/// targets is tightly capped (see MPVMetalViewController's per-file read-ahead sizing). This setting
/// moves the big buffer to an ON-DISK cache (`cache-on-disk=yes` + `cache-dir`), so a viewer can pick
/// a large forward buffer (seek minutes ahead without re-buffering, pre-cache) WITHOUT spending RAM.
///
/// CRITICAL SAFETY (the two owner guardrails):
///   1. Unbounded growth is impossible. `UNLIMITED` and any large finite value are still capped at a
///      fraction of CURRENT FREE DISK at the moment the player starts (`resolvedMaxBytes`), so the
///      cache can never fill the device. The cap is recomputed every time a file loads.
///   2. A finished title does not persist. The cache directory is wiped on a genuine playback exit
///      (the finish / leavePlayback path) and again as a safety sweep on app launch, so a crash can
///      never leave an unbounded cache behind.
///
/// `cache-on-disk` has been a stable libmpv option since mpv 0.30 (2019); MPVKit 0.41.0 (mpv 0.41.x)
/// includes it. If a future mpv build ever drops it, the options simply no-op and mpv falls back to
/// the in-memory cache bounded by `demuxer-max-bytes`, which is still clamped by `resolvedMaxBytes`.

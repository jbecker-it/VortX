// Libdovi (libdovi's C API, vendored inside MPVKit-GPL alongside FFmpeg) is used to convert a Dolby Vision
// Profile 7 RPU to Profile 8.1 in-flight so AVPlayer/VideoToolbox can decode it as TRUE DV. It is linked into

import Libdovi

/// DV-for-MKV STREAMING remux (Phase 1). Opens an MKV from a debrid HTTP(S) URL and stream-copies it into a
/// fragmented MP4, writing the muxed bytes to an in-memory `VortXRemuxBuffer` via a CUSTOM AVIO write callback
/// (no file, no disk). `VortXRemuxResourceLoader` serves that buffer to AVPlayer as `vortxremux://` byte
/// ranges, so AVPlayer plays TRUE Dolby Vision (Profile 5 / 8.1 / 8.4) out of an MKV that AVFoundation cannot
/// demux directly. Stream-copy re-wraps the exact HEVC access units, so the DV RPU (SEI NALs) + the DOVI
/// config box survive; only the container changes.
///
/// What the output CARRIES is constrained by what AVPlayer can actually play:
///   - Video: single-layer DV Profile 5 / 8.x plays as a pure stream-copy. Dual-layer Profile 7 (BL+EL, i.e.
///     ~every UHD-BluRay DV rip) is CONVERTED on the fly to Profile 8.1: AVPlayer/VideoToolbox cannot decode
///     Profile 7's enhancement layer, but it CAN decode the Profile 8.1 base layer as true DV. We drop the EL
///     (whether a separate MKV track or an in-band UNSPEC63 sublayer NAL) and convert the DV RPU NAL to
///     Profile 8.1 via libdovi, then advertise dv_profile=8 / bl_compat=1 on the output so the mov muxer emits
///     a Profile-8 `dvvC` box and AVPlayer engages true DV. A stream whose DV label lied (no DOVI config) still
///     FAILS FAST (before any video mounts) so the chrome demotes to libmpv's HDR10 tone-map; a Profile-7
///     conversion that errors at runtime also fails soft to that same demotion, never a crash or a hang.
///   - Audio: AVPlayer-decodable codecs (AAC/AC3/EAC3/ALAC/MP3/FLAC) stream-copy through, always preferred.
///     When a source's ONLY audio is a codec AVPlayer cannot decode (TrueHD, DTS/DTS-HD MA, MLP, Opus,
///     Vorbis, PCM variants), that ONE track is TRANSCODED in-flight by `VortXAudioTranscoder` (EAC3-first,
///     else AAC with today's bundled FFmpeg) so the DV lane no longer bails to libmpv's HDR10 tone-map over
///     audio alone. A source with no decodable AND no transcodable audio still fails fast to libmpv.
///   - Subtitles: never mapped. The mp4 muxer cannot stream-copy Matroska text/PGS subtitle codecs
///     (avformat_write_header fails and kills the whole session); the player's add-on/community subtitle
///     panel covers subtitles on the AVPlayer path.
///
/// This mirrors `MKVRemuxSession`'s proven file-based remux (open input, map video/audio/subtitle streams,
/// `avcodec_parameters_copy`, fragmented-mp4 movflags, `av_read_frame` -> `av_interleaved_write_frame`) but
/// swaps the file sink for `avio_alloc_context` with a write callback appending to the buffer.
///
/// Phase-1 scope: FORWARD-ONLY. The custom AVIO exposes no working seek to the muxer, and the source is read
/// straight through, so AVPlayer scrubbing past buffered content is a documented TODO. The remux loop runs on
/// one dedicated background thread; `cancel()` requests a clean stop and the loop tears down in the correct

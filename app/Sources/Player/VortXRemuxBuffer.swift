/// A thread-safe, forward-only growing byte buffer for the DV-for-MKV streaming remux (Phase 1). The remux
/// thread (`VortXMKVRemuxStream`) appends muxed fragmented-MP4 bytes as they are produced; the local HLS
/// server (`VortXRemuxHLSServer`, the default delivery) reads closed-segment byte ranges out of it, and the
/// legacy progressive loader (`VortXRemuxResourceLoader`, the rollback path) reads it sequentially.
///
/// Design notes:
/// - APPEND-ONLY at the head, with ONE narrow exception. Bytes are almost always added only at the end, matching
///   a forward-only stream-copy remux that writes fMP4 fragments in order. The exception is `overwrite(at:)`: the
///   mov muxer (movenc) writes every box with a 32-bit size PLACEHOLDER and later seeks back to patch it once the
///   box length is known. When a box (chiefly the init `moov`) outgrows the muxer's AVIO buffer, that backpatch
///   cannot be done in the muxer's own unflushed buffer and must rewrite bytes already stored here. `overwrite`
///   patches those already-produced bytes in place; it never grows the stream and never advances `producedCount`.
///   It is only ever used to correct box-size fields the muxer already emitted, so a reader that has not yet been
///   handed those bytes (the init segment is not served until it is fully indexed) always sees the corrected value.
/// - BOUNDED SLIDING WINDOW at the tail. Both deliveries consume the stream front-to-back: the legacy loader
///   advertises NO byte-range access (`isByteRangeAccessSupported = false`) so AVPlayer streams strictly
///   sequentially from offset 0, and the HLS server only serves CLOSED segments of an append-only EVENT
///   playlist, so once a byte has been read it is essentially never re-requested. We therefore drop bytes that
///   sit well below the reader's low-water mark, keeping only a small re-read floor plus a bounded producer
///   lead (the producer BLOCKS in `append` once resident bytes hit floor + lead, so a slow/paused reader can
///   never let it run away). This caps RAM at roughly (floor + producer lead) instead of the whole
///   movie, which on a feature-length 4K DV MKV would be many GB and jetsam the app on the memory-constrained
///   Apple TV. `storageBase` is the absolute offset of `storage[0]`; a reader's absolute offset maps to
///   `absolute - storageBase`. The window floor is a RemoteConfig dial (`dvRemuxWindowMiB`) so it can be tuned
///   or widened from the fleet like the other jetsam knobs, and a seek Phase-2 that needs byte-range access can
///   raise it.
/// - Thread-safety is a single `NSCondition`: producers append + signal, consumers wait for enough bytes or
///   for end-of-stream. All shared mutable state (`storage`, `storageBase`, `isFinished`, `failureMessage`,
///   `producedCount`) is touched only while the condition's lock is held.
///
/// This type carries NO libav or AVFoundation types, so it compiles on every target and is trivial to reason
/// about in isolation.

/// WHY: on every platform the fullscreen player is presented OVER the browse UI, which stays mounted
/// underneath (opacity-hidden on tvOS, under a fullScreenCover on iOS / a hoisted host on macOS) - so a
/// mounted in-hero trailer (`InHeroTrailerView` / `TVInHeroTrailerView`) kept its own libmpv instance
/// decoding and re-fetching a looping 1080p trailer for the WHOLE movie: micro stutter, audio crackle,
/// and doubled bandwidth on every stream started while a hero clip was up (the 0.3.9 full-trailer hero
/// regression). The player screens drive this gate from onAppear/onDisappear; the hero views unmount
/// their clip while `playerActive` and remount when playback closes.
///
/// Main-thread only (SwiftUI appear/disappear callbacks and view bodies), so no locking is needed.

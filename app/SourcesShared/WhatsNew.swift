        "Playback starts right away again. Tapping a source, or Watch Now, now begins in a second or two instead of loading for up to half a minute and flashing \"source failed\" first. When a source cannot open on the native player it falls back to the built-in player on the same source instantly, so you get the source you picked rather than a lower-quality one, and HLS and Dolby Vision still play on the native player.",
        "Posters are bigger by default. Catalog and rail cards now open at a larger, more cinematic size out of the box on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and you can still tune the size in Settings, Appearance, Poster Style.",
        "Continue Watching now clears titles you have finished. A movie you watched to the end, marked as watched, or finished on another device no longer lingers in the row, and a series you are partway through still shows so you can pick up the next episode.",
        "The Streaming Services logos are now clearly legible. Every brand mark sits on a clean light plate, so marks like Apple TV+ and Paramount+ no longer blend into their tile.",
        "Account sync no longer silently drops a change when two devices save at the same moment, and your add-on order now stays consistent across your devices and the web dashboard.",
        "A cleaner, more cinematic look: full-bleed artwork, a bold new Play button, and a more spacious, premium layout across the app. On Mac the design now uses the full width of the window, with a larger hero and a roomier reading column instead of a stretched phone layout.",
        "Dolby Vision now plays from Dolby Vision MKV files, with true DV passthrough (turn it on in Settings). Dual-layer Profile 7 files, the kind most 4K Blu-ray rips use, now play as true Dolby Vision too instead of tone-mapping to HDR10. When a file genuinely can't do true DV (no Dolby Vision data or unsupported audio), playback still falls back to HDR10 automatically instead of erroring, and the engine never switches mid-movie.",
        "Community subtitles now appear in the player's subtitle panel again when you are signed in to VortX, are selectable, and load and stay in sync, plus an \"also available in\" language row on every title.",
        "Add-on subtitles reliably appear in the player's subtitle panel again, including on streams that never report a duration.",
        "Continue Watching resumes faster and more reliably, straight from your debrid account.",
        "Install add-ons by scanning a QR code with your phone, no typing on the TV.",
        "Titles, posters, and logos now show in your language across every catalog, with a region picker and per-category Discover controls in Settings.",
        "Resume timestamps, poster style options, a working subtitle-sync control, and cached-source lightning.",
        "Detail-page polish: a tap-to-expand Cast & Crew section, a \"More Like This\" row that follows your poster style, a poster-labels toggle right in Settings, and an option to combine Discover and Search into one tab.",
        "The player scrubber now shows how much has buffered ahead, with a light grey track behind the playhead, just like YouTube.",
        "Trending, genre and streaming-service tiles now open straight to full details, ratings, artwork and playable sources on iPhone, iPad and Mac, and catalogs keep showing posters and art even when the source is busy.",
        "More reliable downloads, and on Apple TV the \"also available in\" row now shows full language names instead of codes.",
        "The full-trailer button now works on every Apple TV, including the no-server Lite build, and a new Trailer language option in Settings picks trailers in your preferred language.",
        "Offline HLS downloads on iPhone and iPad: adaptive streams now download properly for watching offline, and switching between catalog categories no longer sticks on a loading spinner.",
        "The muted trailer that plays behind the hero on Home and detail pages is now the real full trailer, played quietly and looping, the same source as the Trailer button. When a title has no trailer, the still artwork stays as before.",
        "The Streaming Services tiles now show each service's real brand logo, built into the app, so Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Max, Apple TV+ and more appear instantly and cleanly instead of a stretched icon or a single letter.",
        "Scrub-preview thumbnails now build and share from every title you watch, including everything opened from the Streaming Services, Trending and genre collections. Previously those plays were skipped, so timeline previews stayed empty; now every watch makes scrubbing better for everyone.",
        "Trailers now play straight from your own device at up to 1080p, resolved on the spot instead of routed through a server, so they start faster and look sharper. The ambient trailer behind the hero uses the same path, and many trailers that used to say the source did not load now play reliably.",
        "Cached sources start faster: when a source that looks cached is not actually ready on your account, the player now moves on in a couple of seconds instead of waiting out a long timeout, so you reach a source that plays much sooner.",
        "Pause and cancel now keep working on a download even after you fully quit and reopen the app: an in-progress download that kept running in the background is picked back up on launch, so its Pause and Cancel controls act on the real transfer again instead of doing nothing.",
        "Watch Now reaches a playable cached source much faster: it now checks the top few cached sources at once and plays the first one that is really ready on your account, instead of trying them one at a time. Picking a specific source yourself still plays exactly that one.",
        "Singularity sources now actually show. When you sign in to VortX and turn on Singularity sources in Settings, community-corroborated sources appear in the source list alongside your own, on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV. Previously the toggle checked the wrong sign-in and the extra sources never loaded.",
        "Removing an add-on now sticks everywhere. When you delete an add-on on the web dashboard or in the app, it stays gone across your devices and no longer reappears after a Stremio import or a background refresh. Installing the same add-on again later still works.",
        "Posters load reliably and the app is snappier on open. Catalog and hero artwork now uses a much larger image cache and loads a few at a time in the background, so posters no longer come back blank and the app stays smooth while you scroll. Turning the Collections hub on Home or Discover on or off no longer strips artwork from the rows below it.",
        "The source you pick is the source that plays. When you choose a specific 4K, HDR or 1080p source, the player now waits for that exact source instead of quietly dropping to a lower-quality one, and a large 4K file that is still filling gets extra time to start rather than being given up on. Watch Now still moves on automatically when a source is genuinely dead, but it no longer falls all the way to a 480p link when a cached higher-quality one exists, and the \"tried several sources\" message no longer flashes while a source is still starting.",
        "Scrub-preview thumbnails now build from every device, including 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision playback on Mac and iPhone. A capture-timing issue meant some plays generated previews locally but never shared them; timeline previews now come together faster for everyone across all your devices.",

import Combine

/// Owns a detail screen's ENTIRE source-list pipeline off the SwiftUI render path:
/// snapshot -> merge (TorBox search + Singularity) -> tombstone subtraction -> direct-links filter ->
/// StreamRanking, all coalesced and run OFF the main thread, publishing ONE immutable ranked result
/// per real change.
///
/// WHY: the detail bodies used to re-assemble the whole list inside `body` (streamGroups rebuild +
/// two merges + an O(N) signature string over every stream) on EVERY CoreBridge @Published bump, and
/// `revision` bumps 6-7x/sec while sources load. On a 1200+ stream title that saturated the main
/// thread (Mac force-quit, dead keyboard nav, beachball; the earlier DetailRankMemo cached only the
/// rank and deliberately left the assembly outside). This model inverts the flow:
///
///  1. O(1) EPOCH SIGNATURE: a tuple of monotonic epochs (CoreBridge.streamsEpoch, which bumps only
///     when the coalescer saw the ready-stream set really change, plus the TorBox / Singularity
///     source epochs) and one Hasher fold of the small ranking inputs. Comparing signatures is a few
///     Int compares, zero allocation, instead of joining a string over 1256 streams.
///  2. 250 ms TRAILING COALESCER: a Combine throttle (latest: true) over the epoch publishers, so a
///     burst of engine events during source loading produces at most ~4 rebuilds/sec and the LAST
///     event of a burst always lands. It subscribes to the specific publishers, never to
///     CoreBridge.objectWillChange.
///  3. OFF-MAIN ASSEMBLY, PUBLISH ONCE: on a coalesced signature change it snapshots the immutable
///     inputs on the main actor, hops to a detached task for merge + tombstone subtraction + rank
///     (StreamRanking is pure and lock-protected), and publishes ONE `[CoreStreamSourceGroup]` (+
///     `best`) back on the main actor. A generation counter discards a stale completion superseded
///     mid-flight. Steady-state main-thread cost for the UI is an Equatable array check.
///
/// One instance per detail screen (`@StateObject`). The source-list section consumes ONLY
/// `groups` / `best`; it must not derive the list from CoreBridge inside `body` anymore.

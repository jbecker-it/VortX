/// Client-side request signing for the hardened VortX edge workers.
///
/// VortX's first-party edge services (skip / trickplay / ratings / poster / erdb / trailer) are
/// fronted by Cloudflare Workers that verify an HMAC signature so a request can be attributed to a
/// real VortX build rather than a scraper hammering the free, keyless endpoints. `sign(_:)` is the
/// one place that stamps a request; every URLSession call site that targets one of OUR gated hosts
/// runs the outgoing `URLRequest` through it right before it is sent.
///
/// THE SIGNING CONTRACT (must match the workers byte-for-byte):
///   - Header `X-VX-Ts`: current unix time in SECONDS, as an integer string.
///   - Header `X-VX-Sig`: lowercase hex of HMAC-SHA256(key, message).
///   - key     = the UTF-8 bytes of the 64-char hex secret STRING (NOT hex-decoded): `Data(secret.utf8)`.
///   - message = METHOD (uppercase) + "\n" + url.path + "\n" + ts
///               (url.path is the path only: no query, no host, e.g. "/skip", "/tp/<key>",
///                "/v1/ratings/tt...", "/clip"). The default HTTP method is GET.
///
/// SECRET PROVENANCE (no-leak):
///   The secret is read ONCE from Info.plist key `VortXEdgeSecret`, which Xcode substitutes from the
///   `VORTX_EDGE_SECRET` build setting. That value comes from the GITIGNORED `Config/VortXEdge.xcconfig`
///   locally (or a CI GitHub repo secret), and defaults to EMPTY. The public repo never carries a real
///   value. An empty / absent secret makes signing a safe no-op: an empty-key signature is still
///   attached, which the workers' OBSERVE mode lets through, so nothing breaks until the owner
///   provisions the real key and the workers flip to enforce.

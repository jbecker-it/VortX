/// Durable cross-device REMOVE tombstones for add-ons, the add-on analogue of
/// `ProfileStore`'s `deletedProfiles` set. The app OWNS this set (it lives in
/// `doc.vortx.deletedAddons`, the app's namespace) so an add-on the user removed on one device can
/// never be resurrected by a peer device's UNION hydrate or a stale pre-removal cloud blob.
///
/// Today add-on hydration is install-only (UNION): `hydrateEngineFromOwnedAddons` reinstalls every
/// owned descriptor and `vortxSummary` re-unions the engine set into `doc.vortx.addons`, so a removal
/// on device A is silently undone on device B (and re-unioned back into the doc). This tombstone set
/// closes that gap exactly the way `deletedProfiles` closes it for profiles:
///
///  - WRITE on an in-app Remove (`CoreBridge.uninstallAddon`) so the removal syncs.
///  - PUSH the EFFECTIVE removed set into `doc.vortx.deletedAddons` from `vortxSummary`, and SUBTRACT it
///    from the `doc.vortx.addons` UNION so a removed add-on is never re-unioned back in.
///  - FOLD an incoming `doc.vortx.deletedAddons` (plus its `doc.vortx.deletedAddonsTs` companion, and a
///    web-authored `doc.webAddonRemovals`) into the local state on a SUCCESSFUL `.doc` pull, then
///    UNINSTALL any still-installed EFFECTIVELY-removed add-on from the engine.
///  - EXCLUDE effectively-removed URLs from `ownedAddons(from:)` so the hydrate path never reinstalls them.
///
/// LAST-WRITER-WINS model. Each transportUrl carries two per-entry timestamps: `removedAt` (stamped by
/// `tombstone`) and `addedAt` (stamped by `forget`). A URL is EFFECTIVELY removed iff `removedAt > addedAt`.
/// Entries are never deleted and each stamp only ever moves forward (local writes and the merge fold both
/// take the per-id MAX), so the set stays a monotone, union-style structure; the only extra bit over a plain
/// set is the recency of the last install versus the last removal, which is what lets a genuine reinstall
/// out-race a stale removal instead of a peer actively re-UNINSTALLING the reinstalled add-on.
///
/// WIRE COMPATIBILITY. `doc.vortx.deletedAddons` keeps its old shape (an array of URLs), now computed as the
/// EFFECTIVE removed set, so the dashboard and older app builds keep reading it exactly as before. The new
/// companion `doc.vortx.deletedAddonsTs` (url -> {removedAt, addedAt}) carries the stamps; clients that do not
/// know the field ignore it. An incoming URL that appears only in the legacy array (including the web-authored
/// `doc.webAddonRemovals`, which is stamp-less) with NO stamp entry is folded at the migration epoch, so any
/// real later reinstall out-races it. Mixed-fleet caveat: an older client's genuine re-removal is
/// indistinguishable from its stale re-emit until that client updates.
///
/// SAFETY: official/protected stubs are NEVER tombstoned (a logout resets the engine to exactly those,
/// so tombstoning one would wrongly suppress a default forever). The state only ever changes from EXPLICIT
/// install/remove intent, never from an inferred diff, and the apply step is gated behind a SUCCESSFUL

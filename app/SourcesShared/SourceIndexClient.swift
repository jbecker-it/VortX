///      debrid / usenet / torrent sources, it reports the source DESCRIPTORS -- NOT the media, NOT any account
///      token or user id. A descriptor is only { kind, id, quality, sizeBytes, sourceTag, seeders? } where `id`
///      is the source's real, re-resolvable identity: a torrent infohash, a usenet nzb link, or the direct
///      http link (owner directive 2026-07-05: share every source type so each user can resolve it with THEIR
///      OWN debrid / TorBox key). The worker STRIPS credential query params before storing, so a contributor's
///      indexer / debrid apikey never lands in the shared pool. Fire-and-forget, batched, deduped by id.
///
///   2. SERVE (opt-in): when the user turns the Singularity toggle ON AND is signed in, the detail / stream
///      screen reads the corroborated pooled sources for the title and MERGES them into the stream list as
///      community sources, ALL kinds now -- torrent (infohash), usenet (nzb link), and direct (http link) --
///      each resolved by the user's own debrid / TorBox pipeline. A legacy hash-only row (older fleet stored

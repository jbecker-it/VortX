///   1. HOARD (default ON, anonymous): whenever the app assembles a title's stream results from its add-ons /
///      debrid / usenet / torrent sources, it reports the source DESCRIPTORS -- NOT the media, NOT the user's
///      personal debrid-unlocked link, NOT any account token or user id. A descriptor is only
///      { kind, id, quality, sizeBytes, sourceTag, seeders? } where `id` is a stable public identity of the
///      source (a torrent infohash, a usenet nzb id, or sha256(url) for a direct link -- never the raw url).
///      Fire-and-forget, batched into one POST, deduped by descriptor id.
///
///   2. SERVE (opt-in): when the user turns the Singularity toggle ON AND is signed in, the detail / stream
///      screen reads the corroborated pooled sources for the title and MERGES the actionable ones (torrent
///      infohash + usenet nzb) into the stream list, labeled as community sources. Direct-link entries are
///      keyed by sha256(url) with no recoverable url, so they cannot be reconstructed and are dropped. Empty
///      on any miss; signed-out disables the read entirely (hard login gate, matching the worker).

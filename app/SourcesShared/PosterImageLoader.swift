/// The single poster / catalog-art byte loader shared by every native Apple surface (iPhone, iPad, Mac,
/// tvOS). It exists because the app was decoding poster bytes ON the main actor and fetching every poster
/// through `URLSession.shared`, whose default `URLCache` is far too small to hold a catalog page. The result
/// was the "half the posters stay blank + the whole app is laggy on open" report: posters thrashed the tiny
/// shared cache (constant re-fetch), competed with trickplay / ratings / sync on the same connection pool,
/// and each decode blocked the main thread while the user scrolled.
///
/// This loader fixes all three:
///   1. A DEDICATED, generously-sized `URLCache` (`configureSharedCache`, called once at launch) so a whole
///      catalog page of poster bytes stays cached across scrolls and relaunches instead of evicting.
///   2. A BOUNDED-concurrency gate (`ConcurrencyGate`) so a grid appearing fires a handful of fetches at a
///      time, never hundreds at once (which is what starved individual posters into coming back empty).
///   3. OFF-MAIN decode + downsample via ImageIO, so the main thread never decodes a poster while scrolling.
///
/// A decoded in-memory `NSCache` sits on top so a poster shown in several rails decodes once. Every miss is
/// retried on the next appear (a scroll-away cancel is not a failure), so a transient miss never latches a
/// permanently blank card. Callers keep their own frame / crop / clip; this only returns the decoded image.

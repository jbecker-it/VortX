/// (`vortx-trailer/src/yt_resolve.ts`): POST the public InnerTube `/player` endpoint as a set of app clients
/// that return PLAIN progressive/adaptive URLs (no signatureCipher, no ciphered `n`), and only ever accept a
/// format whose `url` is present directly. On a residential IP the IOS/ANDROID clients return the full
/// streamingData: muxed itag 22/18 AND adaptive 1080p+.
///
/// Modern trailers are ADAPTIVE-ONLY at EVERY height on the residential IOS client: the `/player` answer is
/// playable OK with ZERO muxed formats (no itag 18/22) and a split video-only + audio-only set up to 1080p
/// (verified live). libmpv plays that natively when the audio-only stream is handed over as an `--audio-file`
/// sidecar, which is why `Resolved` carries an optional `audioURL`. So the resolver prefers a muxed format
/// only WHEN the client actually exposes one, and otherwise returns the adaptive pair at whatever height is
/// offered (it does NOT require the pair to be > 720). A pure-AVPlayer context that cannot take a sidecar can
/// still pass `wantMuxedOnly: true` to get muxed-or-nil, but no shipping trailer/ambient caller does: they all
/// play through mpv (the button mounts the audio sidecar, the muted ambient just renders the video-only leg).

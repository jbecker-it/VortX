/// In-hero auto-play trailer for the iOS / iPad / Mac detail page and Home billboard (#44). It plays a
/// libmpv-playable trailer URL: a DIRECT (non-YouTube) trailer stream, or the server's `/yt/{id}` resolver
/// URL (owner FINAL architecture: the FULL trailer resolved on demand through the app's own server route and
/// played NATIVELY, the same path our YouTube URL playback uses). The muted ambient loop is now that same
/// full `/yt` trailer; the retired R2 `/clip` billboard snippet is gone (owner directive).
/// This is the PRIMARY iOS/Mac hero-trailer path on every server-capable build; the WKWebView IFrame twin
/// (`InHeroYouTubeTrailerView`) is only the Lite/no-server fallback. (The tvOS twin `TVInHeroTrailerView` is
/// the only libmpv hero-clip path on its platform, since tvOS has no web view.)
///
/// A muted, looping, chromeless libmpv layer fades in OVER the still backdrop a short beat after the hero
/// settles. The still art underneath is the permanent fallback, so a missing / slow / blocked clip never
/// leaves the band black.
///
/// Two loop modes (matching tvOS): pass `window` for a short SILENT WINDOW (the DETAIL hero shows a brief
/// snippet), or leave it nil for the whole muted trailer on a built-in `loop-file=inf` loop (the HOME
/// featured hero). The same view serves both so the home + detail heroes share one decorative libmpv layer.
///
/// Gating + fallback (mirrors tvOS exactly):
///   • The caller gates on the `stremiox.autoplayTrailers` setting + `accessibilityReduceMotion`, and only
///     mounts this view when a trailer's `playableURL` resolved, so reduced-motion / setting-off / no-server
///     never starts a clip.
///   • The clip plays only when the embedded server is reachable (checked async on appear). On the Lite
///     build there is no `/yt` route, so `TrailerRequest.playableURL` is nil and the caller never builds
///     this view: it cleanly no-ops to the still backdrop.
///   • If libmpv reports a load failure (`endFileError`, e.g. resolution failed), the clip hides and the
///     still backdrop stays. No error is ever surfaced.
///
/// Lifecycle: a dedicated lightweight libmpv `Coordinator` is created per mounted instance and torn down
/// when the view disappears. Keyed on the trailer URL so rotating A -> B rebuilds the layer for B rather
/// than painting A's clip over B's backdrop.

/// brand tiles: the provider's official mark at a sane medium size, centered on the brand's flat color,
/// NOT an edge-to-edge crop. This file owns the two curated maps that make that possible:
///
///   - `brandColor(for:)`: a flat background color for the majors (Netflix black, Prime blue, Disney
///     navy, Apple near-black, Max/HBO, Paramount blue, Peacock black, ...). Anything unmapped falls
///     back to the warm neutral `surface2` so a regional/long-tail provider still reads as a finished
///     tile (its own logo art usually already carries the brand color).
///   - `canonicalProviderID(for:)` + `dedupeProviders(_:)`: collapse TMDB's split provider entries that
///     the owner saw as duplicate tiles - most visibly TWO Apple TV tiles (id 2 "Apple TV" store vs
///     id 350 "Apple TV+" subscription), plus the Prime (9/119), Max/HBO Max (1899/384) and
///     Discovery+ (520/524) alias pairs. One brand -> one tile, keeping the first (higher-ranked) entry.
///
/// We ship NO copyrighted brand artwork: the logo image is always TMDB's official `logo_path` (already
/// used elsewhere). Only the flat brand COLOR lives here, which is not itself protectable art.
///
/// Region-awareness for H1 is handled upstream: `TMDBClient.regionProviders` already builds the list from
/// `watch/providers/{media}?watch_region=<region>`, so Sony LIV / Zee5 / JioCinema / Rakuten Viki and the
/// rest surface automatically wherever TMDB lists them for the user's (configurable) region. This file only
/// styles + dedupes whatever that region query returns.

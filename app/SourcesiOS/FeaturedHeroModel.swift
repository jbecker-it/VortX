/// has no pointer to follow, so the hero is a SELF-DRIVEN ambient billboard (Netflix/Disney+ style):
///
///   - A small randomized pool of candidates (the top items of the screen) cross-fades every
///     `heroRotateInterval`, as a still backdrop with the Play + detail overlay.
///   - The hero is fully DECOUPLED from the catalog grid/rails: it does NOT auto-select, focus, or
///     ring any poster, and tapping a poster opens that title's detail through normal navigation —
///     it never "features" the tapped title in the hero.
///   - Rotation STOPS the moment the user interacts (scroll / hover / select) and resumes only after
///     a spell of inactivity (`heroResumeAfter`). Reduce Motion disables rotation entirely.
///
/// Each featured item is enriched with logo + trailer + synopsis through a SELF-CONTAINED meta
/// fetch (Cinemeta + installed meta add-ons), replicating the tvOS enrichment but kept entirely
/// inside SourcesiOS so the tvOS target is untouched. Continue-Watching seeds carry no catalog meta,
/// so this enrichment is what gives a CW hero its title/rating/year/genres/synopsis. Enrichment is
/// cached by id so re-showing a title (rotation looping, or returning to the screen) is instant.

/// were built against, so wiring it in is a one-line change at the injection site (the ViewModelFactory)
/// with zero UI churn.
///
/// How it bridges the request/response gap: stremio-core is event-driven, not request/response. Each
/// repository call (a) dispatches the matching Load action, (b) suspends until the engine emits a
/// `NewState` event naming the field it drives, then (c) pulls + parses that field's JSON. A timeout
/// guards against a field that never re-emits (e.g. the engine had it cached and ActionLoad was a
/// no-op), in which case we read whatever state is currently present.
///
/// Threading: [StremioXCore.EventListener.onEvent] fires on a native worker thread; we forward the
/// changed field names into a [MutableSharedFlow] that suspend functions await. Parsing runs on the
/// caller's coroutine.

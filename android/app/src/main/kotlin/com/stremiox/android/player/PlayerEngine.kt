/// The engine-agnostic seam the Compose chrome drives. Both players (libmpv and ExoPlayer) implement
/// this, so [PlayerChrome] and [PlayerScreen] talk to ONE interface and never branch on which engine is
/// live. It mirrors the Apple player's split: the SwiftUI chrome renders [PlayerState] and calls
/// transport methods, while the concrete engine owns the surface + decode.
///
/// Contract:
///   - [state] is a hot [StateFlow] the chrome collects (position/duration/paused/tracks/ended). The
///     engine republishes it from its own property observers on its own thread; the chrome never reads
///     the engine directly.
///   - [VideoSurface] is the engine's render surface, hosted via Compose `AndroidView`. mpv attaches an
///     Android `Surface` from a `SurfaceView`; ExoPlayer hosts a Media3 `PlayerView` (SurfaceView mode).
///   - transport methods are idempotent and safe to call before the first frame; the engine buffers or
///     no-ops until it is ready.
///
/// Fail-soft: [MpvEngineFactory] can return null (mpv init/attach failure, or the `play` flavor that
/// ships no libmpv), and [PlayerEngineRouter] then hands the stream to the ExoPlayer engine so playback
/// degrades to Media3 instead of a black crash.

///   - `src/full/.../MpvEngineFactory.kt` builds the real `MpvPlayer`, catching any native create /
///     surface-attach failure and returning null so the router falls back to ExoPlayer.
///   - `src/play/.../MpvEngineFactory.kt` always returns null (that flavor ships no libmpv AAR), so the
///     `play` build compiles and always runs on ExoPlayer.
/// Kotlin resolves the flavor-specific copy at compile time, the JVM analogue of Apple's `#if` engine
/// gating. The contract both copies satisfy:
///
///     object MpvEngineFactory { fun create(context: android.content.Context): PlayerEngine? }
///
/// It intentionally does NOT live here: a `src/main` copy plus a flavor copy is a duplicate-class build
/// error (the flavor source set is additive to main, not an override of a same-named declaration).
